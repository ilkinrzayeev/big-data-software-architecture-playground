## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive, production-grade Java project inspired by the [University of Colorado Boulder’s “Fundamentals of Software Architecture for Big Data”](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-software-architecture-for-big-data) course.

Each module demonstrates advanced software engineering, distributed systems, monitoring, and messaging solutions with real-world code, TDD, and deep documentation. All core data structures are implemented from scratch—no built-in Java collections are used for the main logic.

## Modules

### 1. Software Engineering Overview (Aged Cache)
- **Goal:** Implement a custom O(1) cache with TTL-based eviction, no built-in collections, full TDD, and concurrency support.
- **Highlights:**  
  - Custom hash table and linked list for storage  
  - Thread-safe operations  
  - Expiry and eviction logic
  - 
- **Usage Example:**
  ```java
  SimpleAgedCache cache = new SimpleAgedCache();
  cache.put("key", "value", 1000);
  Object value = cache.get("key");
  ```

### 2. Fundamentals of Software Architecture (Blockchain)
- **Goal:** Build a custom singly linked list blockchain with SHA-256 hashing, genesis block, and chain validation.
- **Highlights:**  
  - No built-in List/Map  
  - Genesis block auto-creation  
  - Block linking and hash validation  
  - Tampering and edge-case tests
- **Usage Example:**
  ```java
  Blockchain chain = new Blockchain();
  chain.addBlock("data");
  Block latest = chain.getLatestBlock();
  ```

### 3. Production Software Fundamentals (Monitoring)
- **Goal:** Thread-safe service monitoring, background job simulation, and real-time metrics with stress and concurrency tests.
- **Highlights:**  
  - Service availability calculation  
  - Background job scheduler  
  - Metrics reset and stress tests  
  - Concurrency and edge-case handling
- **Usage Example:**
  ```java
  MonitoringService service = new MonitoringService();
  service.recordRequest(true);
  double availability = service.getAvailability();
  ```

### 4. Production Databases & Messaging (Message Queue)
- **Goal:** Custom message queue with thread-safety, capacity management, and advanced test coverage.
- **Highlights:**  
  - Custom queue (no built-in collections)  
  - Enqueue/dequeue with capacity checks  
  - Thread-safe, stress and concurrency tests
- **Usage Example:**
  ```java
  MessageQueue<String> queue = new MessageQueue<>(10);
  queue.enqueue("msg");
  String msg = queue.dequeue();
  ```
